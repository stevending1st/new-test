Are you looking for some quick and easy Python projects to build?

We've released a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will show you how to build six Python projects in just over an hour. It is the perfect video if you don't have time for [this 24-hour C# course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfWxdh-_k_4). 😀

This course was created by Code With Tomi. He has created many great courses on his own YouTube channel.

These quick projects will help you improve your Python skills. Here are the six projects you will build:

-   Web Scraper

-   Weather Program
-   Countdown Timer
-   Password Generator
-   QR Code Reader and Generator
